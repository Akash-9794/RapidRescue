RapidRescue: Emergency Response Web App
Concept of the Project
RapidRescue is a web application designed to enhance emergency response efficiency by automatically notifying registered hospitals and clinics about accidents. By leveraging geolocation technology, the app shares the user's location with the nearest ambulance and hospital, facilitating swift and coordinated emergency response. The project aims to save lives by minimizing response times and bridging communication gaps between accident sites and medical services. Key functionalities include accident reporting, automatic location detection, real-time notifications, and proximity prioritization.

Problem Statement
Current challenges in emergency response include delayed response times, communication gaps between accident sites and medical services, and inefficiencies in locating the nearest available ambulance and hospital. Addressing these challenges requires the development of RapidRescue, a comprehensive platform that automates notifications and prioritizes proximity to ensure timely medical intervention.
